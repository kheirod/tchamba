# Tchamba.random
Tchamba.random, is a real random data genarator (letters, jokes, names...)

## The idea
The name was invented by my friends Hammadi Ilyes and Bahri Aimene, and it was a joke. Now [we] are trying to implement it in order to get a random data.

## Installation
First install the **tchamba** package
```bash
  pip install tchamba
```
## How to use
Import **tchamba** in your python file and use any of the functions :
```python
    from tchamba import *

    # Print a random letter (Uppercase and undercase letters included)
    print random_letter()

    # Print a random lowercase letter
    print random_lowercase()

    # Print a random uppercase letter
    print random_uppercase()

    # Print a random digit
    print random_digit()

    # Print a random punctuation mark ( includes these chars !"#$%&\'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~  )
    print random_punctuation()

    # Print a random printable char from the concatenation of digits, ascii_letters, punctuation, and whitespaces. 
    # [might return crazy characters like a Carriage Return, a Vertical Tabulator, or a Form Feed]
    print random_printable()

    # To print a random Chuck Norris joke (Internet connection needed)
    print random_chuck_joke()

    # Print a random hex color (ex: #02c65a)
    print random_hex_color()

    # Print a list of RGB color (ex: [31,12,15])
    print random_rgb_color()

    # Print a random Pokemon name (Internet connection needed)
    print random_pokemon()

    # Get a fake person (Internet connection needed)
    person = random_fake_person()
    for i in person:
        print i, person[i]
   
    
    # Get a random football team (Internet connection needed)
    football_team = random_football_team()
    
    #Get a random country and city  (ex : Iraq Basra ) (Internet connection needed)
    print random_country_and_city()
     
```
